                  <h3>PROFILE: MARK GAUNT</h3>
                  <p>A DipRP qualified recruitment director/manager with extensive 360 recruitment experience – mainly covering the IT and FE/work-based learning sectors. Joined The Developer Academy in Feb 2020, as a member of their newly established coding bootcamp, and the objective now is to make the transition from IT recruiter to IT developer! Coding tech stack covers: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, MERN Stack (React, Express, Node.JS, MongoDB, Mongoose) and some basic Python.</p>
                  <h3>OBJECTIVE:</h3>
                  <p>After spending many years working in the recruitment industry, my objective is to now change career direction and obtain a Junior Developer position. This has been an ambition held for many years, but only now – with the option of flexible learning via The Developer Academy’s online course/developer bootcamp – have I been able to put the wheels in motion. As detailed above, the course is delivered through both online assessments and three weekly group sessions (each session 3 hours long) held evenings/weekends in Sheffield (this moved fully to an online/Zoom model post March due to Covid19). Prior to signing up for this course, I had already completed some online Javascript training – but with TDA’s tutor/mentor access, I was able to take my training to the next level. The tutors/mentors at TDA are from the industry and work with some of the region’s leading tech employers (ie Sky). They are able to teach students the skills employers really need - ie front and back-end development using Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, MERN Stack (React, Express, Node.JS, MongoDB, Mongoose). Again, my aim is to obtain a Junior Developer post – I appreciate I will need support and further mentorship/training, but I am able to be completely flexible re salary and engagement type (although, full-time perm is obviously the preferred option). Plus, I also bring with me extensive transferable skills; mainly covering recruitment management/resourcing, but also customer service, sales/business development/account management, strategic management and finance/bookkeeping – therefore, I am more than willing to offer additional/dual support in any of these areas to a potential employer!</p>
